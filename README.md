## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Firebase

This project uses Firebase for its backend and loads the necessary credentials from environment variables. You will need to create your own Firebase project and a local environment file to run the application.

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Create a new project.
3. In your project, create a new Web App.
4. You will be given a Firebase configuration object. Copy these credentials.
5. In the root of your project, create a new file named `.env.local`.
6. Add your Firebase credentials to this file in the following format:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN"
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET"
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_APP_ID"
```

**Important**: The `.env.local` file is included in `.gitignore` and should never be committed to your repository. When you deploy to a hosting service like Vercel, you will need to add these as environment variables in the project settings on that platform.

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## üéÆ How to Play

- **Start a Game**: On the home screen, choose a grid size and decide whether to play against the AI or a friend.
- **Invite a Friend**: If you choose to play against a friend, a lobby will be created. Copy the invite link and share it with them.
- **Take Your Turn**: Click between two adjacent dots to draw a line.
- **Complete a Square**: If your line is the fourth side of a 1x1 box, you score a point and get to take another turn.
- **Win the Game**: The game ends when all possible lines have been drawn. The player with the most completed squares wins!
