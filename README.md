### 3. Set Up Firebase

This project uses Firebase for its backend. You will need to create your own Firebase project to get the necessary credentials.

2.  Create a new project.
3.  In your project, create a new Web App.
4.  You will be given a Firebase configuration object. Copy these credentials.
5.  In the project's source code, navigate to `src/firebase/index.ts`.
6.  Replace the placeholder `firebaseConfig` object with your own credentials.

**Note**: For production, it is highly recommended to store these credentials in environment variables rather than hard-coding them.

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## üéÆ How to Play

- **Start a Game**: On the home screen, choose a grid size and decide whether to play against the AI or a friend.

- **Take Your Turn**: Click between two adjacent dots to draw a line.
- **Complete a Square**: If your line is the fourth side of a 1x1 box, you score a point and get to take another turn.
- **Win the Game**: The game ends when all possible lines have been drawn. The player with the most completed squares wins!
